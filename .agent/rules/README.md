# 🤖 Agent Instructions & Workspace Entry

Welcome! This directory contains the consolidated workspace guidelines for the {{PROJECT_NAME}}. Review these instructions to align with project standards.

## 🧭 Navigation Index

- [Project Overview](overview.md) - Tech stack, codebase structure, architecture details, and project specs locator.
- [Development Standards](development.md) - Guardrails, TypeScript guidelines, code styles, and common workflows.
- [Code Review Guidelines](code-review.md) - PR delay rules, review fetching commands, and comment address guidelines.
- [Issue Workflow](workflow.md) - Onboarding rules, GitHub issue lifecycle, templates, and execution protocols.

## ⚡ Core Agent Directives

1. **Safety First**: Never commit directly to `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}`. Run `{{PACKAGE_MANAGER}} audit` before updates. Stop execution immediately on command errors.
2. **Context Integrity**: Keep all documentation, rules, and tests updated as code changes.
3. **No Placeholders**: Do not write stub/placeholder logic. Write complete, functional implementations.
